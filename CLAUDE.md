We are building a web app to support a video game community called Virtual Career Mode. Virtual Career Mode is a self-managed video game league for the game EAFC26 (and future iterations). The community communicates and organizes via Discord but needs a web app. The primary users will be the administrators and team owners. They will log in using their Discord account using Discord's OAuth2.

Phase 1 will be focused on league set up.

Team Set Up:

An admin(s) will enter in all of the teams. A team will have a name, a logo, and an owner.

Competition Set Up:

An admin will create a competition. The types of compeitions will be the same types of soccer competitions that exist in real life such as Double Round Robin, Tournament/Cup, Play Off, etc.

Based off the competition, the admin will need a tool that will auto-generate the schedule of matches. Once the schedule is generated, the app should be set up so that the results are posted and confirmed by either an Admin or the participating team owners. To avoid conflict, if one of the owners is the one to post the score, there will be a button that another owner would be able to click to report the result as incorrect in which the Admin team can come in and triage/handle.

Phase 2 will be about setting up the player database and rosters.
